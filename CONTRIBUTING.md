## Code Style and Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

### Linting with Pylint

Run pylint to check for code quality issues:

```console
$ pylint src
```

The project configuration is in `pyproject.toml`. We disable certain docstring requirements but maintain other quality standards.

### Type Checking with Mypy

We enforce type hints throughout the codebase:

```console
$ mypy src
```

All function definitions must include type annotations.

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Aim for high code coverage (check with `pytest-cov`)

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```console
$ pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:

```console
$ pytest --cov=src
```

## Documentation

- Add docstrings to new functions, classes, and modules
- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Follow the existing documentation style
- Build documentation locally to verify changes:

```console
$ sphinx-build doc doc/_build
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update the CHANGELOG**: Add a brief description of your changes in **CHANGELOG.rst**.

2. **Update AUTHORS**: If this is your first contribution, add your name to the **AUTHORS** file.

3. **Create a Pull Request**: Use our **pull request template**.

4. **Code Review**: A maintainer will review your PR. Be prepared to make changes based on feedback.

5. **Merge**: Once approved and all checks pass, a maintainer will merge your PR.

### Commit Messages

Thank you for contributing to wmoutils!

## Release mechanism

The project follows the MeteoSwiss **GitOps concept**: releases are triggered whenever a Git TAG is created.

The TAG must follow the `semantic version <https://semver.org/>`__ format and `PEP 440 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/>`__ , otherwise the release task will fail.

Steps to follow for a new release:

* Adapt CHANGELOG.rst with release information
* Adapt ``doc/_static/switcher_config.json`` adding the new documentation URL for the release
* Create a new Release in the Github project
